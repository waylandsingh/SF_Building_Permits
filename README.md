# SF_Building_Permits 
### Analyzing building permits for actionable insights in remodelling and construction.

Getting construction completed in San Francisco can be a real drag. 
To reduce the uncertainty of the process, we're predicting the approval timeframe of your builing permit applications, so you'll know how to plan accordingly.

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a number of jupyter notebooks. 
Trained models from the exploration predicting approval type and timeframe were deployed in a flask app.
